# TerraFirmaCraft Assets

This is the official repository for assets used in the TerraFirmaCraft (TFC) minecraft mod, found [here](https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft).

For the time being, this is the current contents of the `/src/main/resources/` folder within the TFC repository. As such, it contains non-art related assets, such as recipes and structures. Once TFC updates to 1.14, this will become purely an art/assets repository.
